# Task1.A.
an array with 10 elements of type int from values 10 to 1 
|
We iterate through the array elements with one for loop to check if the current value of element is greater than the value of next, if it is greater, we swap their positions. 
The effect of our program is: 
  Before: [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] 
  After: [9. 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 ,1, 10]
